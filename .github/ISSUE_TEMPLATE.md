***Before you open an issue, you should search for similar issues.
Especially for issues that deal with starting the docker-registry-frontend we have seen a tremendous amount
of issues and most of the time a reference to the [example-setup](https://github.com/kwk/docker-registry-frontend/tree/v2/example-setup)
folder was enough for the issue reporter to solve the issue on her own.***
